Help on Doggy Sessions                                        *doggy-sessions*

Doggy Sessions is a simple plugin by dogerish that makes managing sessions a 
little easier.

Session Names                                           *doggy-sessions-names*
        Sessions can be named manually or automatically. The session name for 
        a command is determined by the first valid condition of the following:

        1. If [session] is provided. The session will be saved under this name 
           after the name is cleansed. |doggy-sessions-name-cleansing|
        2. If |v:this_session| is not empty. The session will be saved in this 
           file path. No modification is done.
        3. None of the above conditions were met. The session name is assumed 
           to be the tail of the current working directory. This name is then 
           cleansed. |doggy-sessions-name-cleansing|
        
        Name Cleansing                         *doggy-sessions-name-cleansing*
                Session names are cleansed with the following steps before 
                being used as file names.
                
                - All "." characters are replaced with "_"

2. Variables                                        *doggy-sessions-variables*

Sessions Directory                                            *g:sessions_dir*
        Default: $HOME/.vim/sessions
        Before the g:sessions_dir variable is used, the script creates the 
        directory if directory doesn't exist, and appends a slash if 
        g:sessions_dir doesn't already end with one. The default value is used 
        if the variable doesn't exist or is empty.
